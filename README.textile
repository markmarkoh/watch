h1. Watch

Watch is a script reloader. Watch monitors local Javascript and CSS files for changes and automatically reloads the modified file in your browser. 


Examples:

Watch all CSS files for changes and reload them:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;_watch.css("*");&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

Watch 1 Javascript file for changes and reload it:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;_watch.js("test.js");&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

In this next example, <code>test.js</code> is a custom library that leaks 2 variables into the global namespace. We'll pass <code>watch</code> a <code>cleanup</code> function to remove the global variables (optional), and then a <code>reinitialize</code> function to reinit the <code>test.js</code> library.

Watch 1 Javascript file for changes, run a <code>cleanup</code>, reload the script, then run <code>reinit</code>:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;
_watch.js(
  "test.js",
  function () { //cleanup
    delete window.testGlobal1;
    delete window.testGlobal2;
  },
  function () { //reinit 
    test.init(); 
  }
);
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<pre>Staring Watch.js server...
Watch.js server started on port 7202
